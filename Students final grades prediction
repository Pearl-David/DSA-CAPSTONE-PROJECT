Project Title

Design and Deployment of an AI-Powered Predictive System

📌 Overview

This project presents a machine learning solution designed to predict students' final grades based on various academic and personal attributes. Built using Python and deployed with Streamlit, this tool aims to assist educators and institutions in identifying students at risk and enabling timely intervention.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze a real-world student performance dataset.

Build and evaluate a supervised ML regression model.

Deploy the model via a simple and interactive web interface using Streamlit.

Provide real-time predictions of student performance (G3).

🧠 Technologies Used

Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, joblib, streamlit

Deployment: Streamlit (local server)

Model: Random Forest Regressor
